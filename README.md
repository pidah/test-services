# test-tpr-s3

## Test thirdPartyresources s3.

This test service creates a new thirdpartyresource every 60 seconds. The thirdpartyresource created is picked up by the stackstorm sensor which uploads a file to an s3 bucket. The file contains the autogenerated name of the thirdparty resource. 10 seconds after the file is uploaded to s3, this app does a check to validate that the content of the file in s3 matches the name of the autoegenerated thirdpartyresource. If it matches, the state of the service will be saved as OK and return 200 status code. If the validation fails, the service returns a 503 Service Unavailable Status. After saving the state, the app cleans up the thirdpartyresource regardless of whether the s3 validation is succesful or not. The endpoint for this service can be hit with -> `curl test-tpr-s3.default.svc.cluster.local`
This service is polled by test-master https://github.com/pearsontechnology/test-master
